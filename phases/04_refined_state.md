In this phase, as ðŸ§˜ THE ENLIGHTENED FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMER, your role is to embrace the design principles of functional programming and refine the key state components required for the software project, emphasizing the use of pure functions, immutability, and the avoidance of side effects, you will create a foundation for future phases to build upon with confidence. Previously a set of initial fundamental state components was determined; here, you will refine them. Our primary goal in this phase is to find out when the fundamental state components cannot be properly modified based on one or more of the inputs, and to add a state component which allows the state to be properly modified.

Step 1: Define Existing Typed State Components
- The state of the program will be a tuple of the state components. An initial list of fundamental state components was previously determined, which we will refine throughout this phase. In this step, we should more rigorously define the state components' types.
- We will use Typescript to do this.  For each State Component, create a typescript type to express the component.
- Emphasize minimalism and elegance in this step. Do not include extra data or fields in the type if you can avoid it.
Deliverable: Typescript types for each component. Format:
1. **Component 1**
```typescript
type ...
```

Step 2: Define Typed Inputs
- The inupts to the program will be a tuple of the fundamental inputs.  In this step, we should more rigorously define the input compnents' Types
- We will use Typescript to do this.  For each Fundamental Input, create a typescript type to express the input.
- Emphasize minimalism and elegance in this step. Do not include extra data or fields in the type if you can avoid it.
Deliverable: Typescript types for each input. Format:
1. **Input 1**
```typescript
type ...
```
...

Step 3: Consider input-related state components

- Recall that in the previous phase, we arrived at the ruthlessly minimized state components â€“ the bare minimum of state components from which all other components can be derived - which are presented below.
- Despite this, it may be possible that we "over-minimized" and failed to allow for all inputs to be correctly processed at the time they are applied. To solve for this, we will consider the inputs and whether they require introducing additional state components given the typed state components from Step 1.
- Evaluate each input in the context of the previoulsy fundamental state components' types and list:
    - How, precisely, the input would be reflected in an update to a state component. Describe this precisely in terms of the typescript type's fields, and qualities of the typescript type's fields' values, for that state component's type as defined in step 1.
        - Provide an example of how the input would be applied using an actual Typescript object for both the input and the corresponding pre- and post- state components, highlighting the change in the state object after applying the input.
    - A reflection on whether or not that application and example makes sense, i.e. whether or not the fundamental state component XYZ could or could not be updated in the way described, or if this does not make sense in the context of the typescript type of state component XYZ. If relevant, include arguments that the examples would not be well-defined according to the original typescript type. Other examples of why the example might not make sense include:
        - State is not actually changed from pre- to post-
        - The wrong state has been updated
        - The pre- or post- state or the input state do not match the types above
        - The pre- or post- state do not correctly conform to the types above, due to missing or undefined fields
    - What additional state component might be added if the input cannot be applied to the existing state components in a locically consistent manner.
    - If applicable, a recommendation for additional state which would enable the input to be applied in a logically consistent manner.
- Try to minimize any additional added state to be as granular and specific to the input as possible. In line with functional programming principles, the state should still be as minimal and simple as possible, this step is more about eliminating impossibilities than introducing complexity.
Deliverable: Final list of state components including previous fundmental state components, with a brief description of each. Format:
#Input consideration
1. **[Input 1]**
    - Best-guess Application: This input could be applied to [XYZ state component #N] by [modifying/adding/removing] the [specific Typescript type's field(s) of fundamental state component N] so that [specific change in the values of fundamental component's Typescript type's field(s)].
    - Example: [Show a concrete example of applying the input to a state component, displaying concrete objects conforming to the typescript types.]
        - Pre State Component: {{...}}
        - Input: {{...}}
        - Post State Component: {{...}}
    - Reflection: Discuss whether or not the application and example make sense. Consider whether the fundamental state component XYZ could or could not be updated in the way described, or if this does not make sense in the context of the Typescript type of state component XYZ.
    - Potential New Component: [name and brief description for what state component might be added if the best-guess application doesn't make sense]
    - Recommendation (if applicable): Suggest any additional state which would enable the input to be applied in a logically consistent manner.


Step 4: Finalize State Components
- Based on the recommendations above, add any additional state components and list all of them together here.
- List only the names of the components in this final list.

# Final State Components
- [fundamental state components from Step 1]
- ...
- [additional state components recommended by previous step]


Before you begin, here is the relevant output from the previous step, which defined an overview for the project in more detail, defined the set of MVP features which should be included in the project, determined the fundamental program inputs, and determined the fundamental components of the state around which the program will be built.

A brief description of the project:
{overview}

A list of the key MVP features for the project:
{features}

The fundamental inputs to the project's program:
{fundamental_inputs}

The fundamental components to the project's state:
{fundamental_state}

With that context, you should be ready to execute this phase!
