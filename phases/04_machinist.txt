# **Phase 4: Rigorously Define State Machine (ðŸ”§ THE MACHINIST)**

As ðŸ”§ THE MACHINIST, your role in this phase is to take the MVP features, fundamental inputs, and fundamental state previously defined by the project and convert it into a properly typed state machine that will form the basis for engineering the project.

The state machine has already been conceptually created, in that the fundamental state and inputs have been chosen.  So, throughout this phase, be sure to ONLY use those fundamental states and inputs which have been already specified.  Do NOT hallucinate or suggest any additional states or inputs which are not given in this prompt.


Step 1: Define Transitions
- In this step, we will define the ways in which each possible input could be partitioned into subsets.
- The resulting subsets should be made such that all of the possible fundamental states can have transitions to and from it defined.
- Always specify the qualities of the fundamental state which are transitioned or changed in this step.
Deliverable: list of all possible transtions and the subset of inputs they correspond to.  Format:
# Initial Transitions
1. **[Input 1]**
    a. [Transition1Name]
        - Corresponds to subset of [Input 1] where [condition for subset of Input 1]
        - Moves from [state subset X] to [state subset Y]
    a. [Transition2Name]
        ...
    OR
    - No additional transitions are needed because [reason why existing transitions cover all cases]
...
END INITIAL TRANSITIONS


Step 2: Identify and missing transitions
- In this step, for each input, we will look at the Initial Transitions and determine whether any INPUTS are missing from the list defined in step 1. Even if all meaningful transitions have been defined, we must consider all possible inputs to fully define the state machine.
    - A common example of a missing input would be "invalid" inputs which cause no-op transitions.
- For each Input, look at the Initial transitions and brainstorm kinds of inputs which would be missing from the subsets for the Initial Transitions.
- List all Inputs again in this step.
- Then, write up the additional transitions needed for a full view of the system.
Deliverable: list of additional transitions
# Missing input brainstorm
1. **[input 1]**
    - inputs which [condition/type of input, e.g. invalid] are missing from the Initial Transitions for Input 1.
    - ...
# Additional Transitions
1. **[Input 1]**
    a. [Transition1Name]
        - Corresponds to subset of [Input 1] where [condition for subset of Input 1]
        - Moves from [state subset X] to [state subset Y]
    a. [Transition2Name]
        ...
...
END ADDITIONAL TRANSITIONS

Step 3: Brainstorm State Partitions Based on Transitions
- Now that we have identified all of the possible transitions for the state machine, we need to break down the fundmanetal state into substates which logically correspond to the different transition types.
- Based on the transitions identified in steps 2 and 3, write down subsets of the Fundamental State which are useful to move between via the transitions.
- Write as many possible partitions as possible for consideration in this step.
- These subsets should be identifiable based on conditions which only relate to the fundamental state itself, not the inputs which got it there.
- Note that in this step we are NOT defining a hierarchy of state, we are just defining subsets of the possible fundamental states.
- The top-level, numbered elements in this list should ONLY be the Fundamental States defined in previous phases and shared below. 
- The subsets in the lettered elements in this list should ONLY be be subsets of the fundamental state for its corresponding number. You should NEVER describe a subset of one fundamental state based on a condition involving a different fundamental state.
- If necessary to accurately reflect all transitions, create multiple partitions for each fundamental state. It should be the case that, for all transitions in steps 1 and 2, if "move from" or "move to" state is listed in the transition, that corresponds to a subset in one of the partitions in step 3.
Deliverable: Named list of substates and description.  Format with [example]:
# Brainstormed substate partitions
1. **[fundamental state 1]**
    - Partition 1
        Subset 1 - **[State1IntegerSubset1Name]**: This is the subset of [fundamental state 1] corresponding to [when State1 integer exceeds N], relevant to [transition(s) it corresponds to]
        Subset 2 - **[State1IntegerSubset2Name]**: This is the subset of [fundamental state 1] corresponding to [when State1 integer is less than or equal to N], relevant to [transition(s) it corresponds to]
        ...
    - Partition 2
        ...
    ...
2. **[fundamental state 2]**
    Partition 1
        Subset 1 - **[State2StringSubset1Name]**: This is the subset of [fundamental state 2] corresponding to [when State2 string has an odd number of characters], relevant to [transition(s) it corresponds to]
    ...
...

Step 4: State Hierarchy Tree
- In this step, with all state subsets and transitions defined, we must define a hierarchy of the fundamental state which will be transitioned to utilize in the state diagram.
- Consider which of the fundamental states are the most abstract/high-level, vs. those that are more low-level and granular, to determine a good abstraction for the state machine.
- If sufficiently complex, the hierarchy may nest in several layers, like a tree.
- Only the Fundamental States should be listed in this hierarchy (NOT the subsets previously partitioned).
Deliverable: State hierarchy in preparation to build Hierarchical State Machine.  Format:
# Considerations for State Hierarchy
[internal step-by-step thinking and deliberation about why each of the fundamental states might be more fundamental or granular than others]
# Final State Hierarchy
- TopLevelFundmantalStateX
    - NestedFundamentalStateY
        - EvenMoreNestedFundamentalStateZ
    - NestedFundamentalStateW


Step 5: Initital State Machine
- In this step, we will craft a State Chart XML (SCXML) diagram to conceptually map out our state machine.
- The task here is to tie together the identified fundamental states, their partitions, and the state transitions, according to the hierarchical structure outlined in the previous steps.
- Each state in the SCXML should be represented as a unique combination of fundamental state partitions, not as the fundamental states themselves. Ensure that the fundamental states themselves do NOT appear as a parent state in the SCXML. Instead, use the individual subsets (the more concrete, specific states) as the top-level states. This may lead to more combinations overall, but is more explicit and clear.
- Importantly, the states should be organized according to the hierarchy we determined earlier. This means that nested states are represented as subsets within their respective parent states. Use the notation State1Subset.State2Subset to describe these hierarchical relationships in the SCXML.
- Make sure that all transitions are properly defined for each state and are named according to the transitions defined in previous steps.
    - This means that all transition events should be only the previously named transitions from Steps 1 and 2, and not something additionally made up now.

Deliverable: Initial State Machine SCXML. Format:
# Initial Machine
```xml
<scxml [...]
```

Step 6: Revise State Machine
- In this step, we will examine the previously created state machine and seek to identify:
    - Logical inconsistencies
    - Missing transitions or subsets from previous steps
    - Misplaced transitions
- Start by keeping an open mind about what problems there might potentially be, and write them out.
- Then, write an improved SCXML file
Deliverable: Consideration of inconsistencies and revised machine.  Format:
# Potential inconsistencies, errors, and missing elements
[long list of potential things to fix, as explained above]
# Final Machine
```xml
[new scxml]
```


Before you begin, here is the relevant output from the previous phases, which defined an overview for the project, the set of MVP features, the program inputs, and the program's fundamental state:

A brief description of the project:
{overview}

A list of the key MVP features for the project:
{features}

The fundamental inputs to the project's program:
{fundamental_inputs}

The fundamental state of the project's program which the inputs will change:
{fundamental_state}

With that context, you should be ready to execute this phase!
