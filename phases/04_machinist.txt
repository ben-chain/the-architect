# **Phase 4: Rigorously Define State Machine (ðŸ”§ THE MACHINIST)**

As ðŸ”§ THE MACHINIST, your role in this phase is to take the MVP features, fundamental inputs, and fundamental state previously defined by the project and convert it into a properly typed state machine that will form the basis for engineering the project.

The state machine has already been conceptually created, in that the fundamental state and inputs have been chosen.  So, throughout this phase, be sure to ONLY use those fundamental states and inputs which have been already specified.  Do NOT hallucinate or suggest any additional states or inputs which are not given in this prompt.

Step 1: Brainstorm State Partitioning Strategies
- In this step, you will brainstorm different approaches to partitioning the fundamental state based on the relevant program inputs.
- For each state, consider how it would be partitioned according to each input.
- This should allow us to define a more granular state machine in which we transition between subsets of the fundamental state based on input.

Deliverable: Long, extensive, thorough list of partitioning strategies. Format:
# Brainstormed State Partitioning strategies
1. State 1
    a. Partition by [input 1] so that [description of subsets and conditions for each]
    b. Partition by [input 2] so that [description of subsets and conditions for each]
    ...
...

Step 2: Input Partitioning Strategy to define transitions
- In this step, we will define the ways in which each possible input could be partitioned into subsets.
- The resulting subsets should be made such that each subset of the state defined in Step 1 has all of the transitions to and from it defined, corresponding to the subset of inputs defined in this partitioning Step 2.
- Always specify the qualities of the fundamental state which are transitioned or changed in this step.
- List all Inputs again in this step. If there are none missing, state that, with a justification for why the existing transitions cover all possible cases.
Deliverable: list of all possible transtions and the subset of inputs they correspond to.  Format:
# Initial Transitions
1. **[Input 1]**
    a. [Transition1Name]
        - Corresponds to subset of [Input 1] where [condition for subset of Input 1]
        - Moves from [state subset X] to [state subset Y]
    a. [Transition2Name]
        ...
    OR
    - No additional transitions are needed because [reason why existing transitions cover all cases]
...

Step 3: Identify and missing transitions
- In this step, for each input, we will look at the Initial Transitions and determine whether any INPUTS are missing from the list defined in step 2. Even if all meaningful transitions have been defined, we must consider all possible inputs to properly define a state machine.
    - A common example of a missing input would be "invalid" inputs which cause no-op transitions.
- For each Input, look at the Initial transitions and brainstorm kinds of inputs which would be missing from the subsets for the Initial Transitions
- Then, write up the additional transitions needed for a full view of the system.
Deliverable: list of additional transitions
# Missing input brainstorm
1. **[input 1]**
    - inputs which [condition/type of input, e.g. invalid] are missing from the Initial Transitions for Input 1.
    ...
# Additional Transitions
1. **[Input 1]**
    a. [Transition1Name]
        - Corresponds to subset of [Input 1] where [condition for subset of Input 1]
        - Moves from [state subset X] to [state subset Y]
    a. [Transition2Name]
        ...
...

Step 4: State Partition based on transitions
- Now that we have identified all of the possible transitions for the state machine, we need to break down the fundmanetal state into substates which logically correspond to the different transition types.
- Based on the transitions identified in steps 2 and 3, write down subsets of the Fundamental State which are useful to move between via the transitions.
Deliverable: Named list of substates and description.  Format:
# Final substate partition
1. **[fundamental state 1]**
    a. **[State1Subset1Name]**: brief description and relevant transitions it relates to
    b. **[State1Subset2Name]**: ...
    ...
...

Step 5: State Hierarchy Tree
- In this step, with all state subsets and transitions defined, we must define a hierarchy of state to utilize in the state diagram.
- Consider which of the fundamental states are the most abstract/high-level, vs. those that are more low-level and granular, to determine a good abstraction for the state machine.
- If sufficiently complex, the hierarchy may nest in several layers, like a tree.
Deliverable: State hierarchy in preparation to build Hierarchical State Machine.  Format:
# Considerations for State Hierarchy
[internal step-by-step thinking and deliberation about why each of the fundamental states might be more fundamental or granular than others]
# Final State Hierarchy
- TopLevelFundmantalStateX
    - NestedFundamentalStateY
        - EvenMoreNestedFundamentalStateZ
    - NestedFundamentalStateW


Step 5: Conceptual State Diagram
- In this step, you will connect the "conceptual dots" of the state and input together to create a conceptual state diagram for the project, based on the transitions and state subsets defined above.
- Each node in the state diagram should correspond to a SINGLE named state subset from the Step 4 paritions. When there are multiple fundamental states, nest the state diagram.
- Each arrow in the state diagram should correspond to a SINGLE named input subset/transition defined above.
- Utilize the State Hierarchy Tree to build the diagram, so that the top-level state is the outermost in the diagram. (In the example below, State 1 would be at the top of the hierarchy.)

Deliverable: State Diagram, formatted in md/UML.  An example syntax is provided below:

# Initial State Diagram
```plantuml
@startuml

[*] --> State1Subset1

state State1Subset1 {{
  [*] --> State2Subset1
  State2Subset1 --> State2Subset2 : Transition1Name
  State2Subset2 --> State2Subset1 : Transition2Name
  State2Subset1 --> [*] : Transition3Name
}}

State State1Subset2 {{

}}

State1Subset1 --> State1Subset2 : Transition4Name
State1Subset2 --> [*]

@enduml
```


Before you begin, here is the relevant output from the previous phases, which defined an overview for the project, the set of MVP features, the program inputs, and the program's fundamental state:

A brief description of the project:
{overview}

A list of the key MVP features for the project:
{features}

The fundamental inputs to the project's program:
{fundamental_inputs}

The fundamental state of the project's program which the inputs will change:
{fundamental_state}

With that context, you should be ready to execute this phase!
