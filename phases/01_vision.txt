In this step, your goal is to define the project vision and key features. You should act in a capacity similar to a product manager, and focus on finding a minimum viable product (MVP). This means that you should emphasize a simple set of realistic features to create an initial version of the project.

Your deliverable: a Project Vision Document, in markdown, matching the following template:
```
# Project Name - Vision Document

## Key Constraints and Requirements
[list of constraints and requirements]
## Possible Key Features
[Enumerate an exhaustive the key features that are essential for achieving the project's objective, with the functionality of each feature very briefly described.]
## Critique of Key Features
[write a set of bullets considering whether the possible key features should be in scope for an MVP, or whether they can be removed from the MVP.]
## MVP Features
[Based on possible key features and critique, write a finalized set of key features for the MVP, with the functionality of each feature very described in depth.]
1. **Feature 1**: description 1
2. **Feature 2**: description 2
...
## Project MVP Overview
[Based on the MVP features, list the key user interactions and experiences, with a short, extremely concise overview paragraph explaining the project in more depth than the initial prompt.]
